It's that time of the year where we mull over what we accomplished in the past twelve months. Here is my list.

- **Stopped using Google products for personal use.** Migrating my half dozen Gmail accounts was the hardest part. That and finding a viable replacement for YouTube. Spoiler: It does not exist.

- **Deleted unused online accounts.** This includes Linkedin, Hulu, and other online retailers. Needless to say, I had some unpleasant experiences during this process.

- **Uninstalled Flash and Java on OS X.** Surprised I didn't get to this sooner.

- **Enabled two-factor authentication when available.** [Authy] and [1Password] for the win.

- **Launched a Mac app on the App Store.** [A utility][IPinator] that brings native IP geocoding to OS X.

- **Designed a mobile game.** An unforgiving [space survival][Rototo] with a whiff of nostalgia.

- **Co-hosted a podcast.** Props to [Kyle Fiedler][Kyle] for putting up with [my never-ending rants][Tentative].

- **Co-organized a Swift workshop.** [It was a lot of fun][Codeswift], especially the part where I had to sit back and listen to [Jack Nutting][Jack] explain optionals.

- **Released a Safari extension.** It serves to scratch my own [RSS discovery][Syndicate] itch.

- **Got interviewed.** It's on [Workspiration][Interview].

- **Visited San Francisco during WWDC week.** [It was totally worth it][Chris], even without a ticket.

- **Avoided buying an Apple Watch.** Believe me, this one was particularly challenging.

- **Earned a Platinum trophy on PSN**. Better yet, it's from [Bloodborne].

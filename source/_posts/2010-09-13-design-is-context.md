Current trends in the design community seem to favor stripping design of its context; our daily intake of inspirational lists, galleries, and Dribbble shots has hit an all-time high. Our collective focus is gradually shifting towards eye-candy and pixel-perfection, and that can't be good news.

There is nothing fundamentally wrong with [Dribbble] itself. It's the exhibitionist mindset of its audience that makes it all but a suitable venue for sharing design work. Most designers provide little to no background information and commenters can't be bothered to ask. If you are looking for constructive [design feedback], you have to go elsewhere.

When design is taken out of context, it is insignificant at best. Unlike art, design is about solving problems, and appreciating it involves examining its ability to do so. Without context, design is reduced to visual artifacts.

And I am tired of looking at visual artifacts.

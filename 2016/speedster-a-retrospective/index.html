  <section class="post-content">
    <p>Last year, I had the <del>not so</del> brilliant idea to build a connection speed testing app for OS X. Between a full-time job and summer vacations, it took me about 6 months to wrap up a 1.0 using the <a href="http://speedof.me">SpeedOfMe</a> free-while-in-beta API. <a href="https://speedsterapp.com">Speedster</a> was born.</p>

<p>Speed tests are a tricky business. I wasn’t convinced that the app would work for everyone, so I made it free. I also capped the number of daily tests per user to not get my API key revoked, and added an <abbr title="In-app purchase">IAP</abbr> to remove that limitation for good measure.</p>

<p>Shortly after submitting 1.0 for review, the app was rejected for violating section 2.9 of the review guidelines:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.9 Apps that are “demo”, “trial”, or “test” versions will be rejected. Beta Apps may only be submitted through TestFlight and must follow the TestFlight guidelines</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like I wasn’t the only one sailing uncharted waters here. After a couple of back and forths, the app went live on February 1st. Here are some relevant numbers from the first month:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Downloads:</em> 14k.</li>
  <li><em><abbr title="In-app purchase">IAP</abbr>:</em> 212 units.</li>
  <li><em>Revenue:</em> $620.</li>
  <li><em>API usage</em>: 20k requests.</li>
  <li><em>Conversion:</em> 1.5%.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the revenue was generated during the first 2 weeks as the weekly average dropped from $285 to $23 by the end of the month.</p>

<p>On February 20th, I woke up to an email from SpeedOfMe announcing their pricing plans and prompting me to update my billing information.</p>

<p>Uh-oh.</p>

<p>Going with the Pro plan as the only reasonable option, I projected cumulative revenue and costs for the next 12 months, as they taught me in business school:</p>

  <img src="https://unredacted.redalemeden.com/images/graphs/cumulative-costs-sales.svg" alt="[Chart] Cumulative Revenue Projection" />
    
      <figcaption>
        Projected cumulative revenue/costs (purple/orange).
      </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>This did not bode well. Even an optimistic revenue projection wasn’t enough to offset the costs for more than 3 months. Without recurring revenue, Speedster would not be sustainable on the long run.</p>

<p>After 24 hours of hesitation, I pulled the trigger on the <em>Speedster Hero</em> <abbr title="In-app purchase">IAP</abbr> and replaced it with consumable tests packs in 1.1. Here’s how things went since:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://unredacted.redalemeden.com/images/graphs/march-may-sales.svg" alt="[Chart] Daily Sales" />
    
      <figcaption>
        Daily revenue between March 1st and May 12th. Total: $148.
      </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Oops. Consumables aren’t popular outside of games for a reason. The app made a measly $148 since March 1st and the pricing tweaks I did in the course of the last two months did not move the needle.</p>

<p>Remember that projection graph from earlier? Now it looks like this:</p>

  <img src="https://unredacted.redalemeden.com/images/graphs/sales-adjusted-cumulative-costs-sales.svg" alt="[Chart] Readjusted Cumulative Revenue/Cost Projection" />
    
      <figcaption>
        Readjusted cumulative revenue and costs projection (purple and orange respectively).
      </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>Did these changes make things worse? Absoluely. Do I have a clue why? Maybe. Let’s look at some ★☆☆☆☆ reviews:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would stay away from this. Says free but its more like test three times and you must buy it. — Jatilq</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>no ping and 3x per day? — Ojaste</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why pay for a speed test when there are dozens of websites that provide this for free? limit the free version to 3 daily tests? $4 for unlimited? I will use speedtest.net for free — Legatony</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The list goes on, but I will stop here. The gist of it is that the vast majority of users do not see enough value to justify paying for a consumable <abbr title="In-app purchase">IAP</abbr>.</p>

<p>With downloads hovering around a weekly average of 600, the prospects of a surge in revenue are bleak. Something’s gotta give.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://unredacted.redalemeden.com/images/graphs/weekly-downloads.svg" alt="[Chart] Weekly Downloads" />
    
      <figcaption>
        Weekly downloads. Total as of May 12th: 21442.
      </figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>In my last attempt to make this work, I am introducing some breaking changes in 2.0. Here’s an outline:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The app will no longer be free.</li>
  <li>Users will be prompted to use their own SpeedOfMe API keys.</li>
  <li>Existing <em>Hero</em> customers will be grand-fathered until further notice.</li>
  <li>Test packs will remain as a secondary option for those who don’t want to manage their own API keys.</li>
</ul>

<p>Will these changes net me a few more ★☆☆☆☆ reviews? I betcha. But at this point that is the least of my concerns.</p>

<p><em>To be continued</em>.</p>

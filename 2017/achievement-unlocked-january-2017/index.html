    <p>Amidst all the depressing stuff going on, it is sometimes healthy to celebrate the little victories of everyday life. Here is a round-up to follow up on <a href="/2015/achievement-unlocked-2015">the one</a> I wrote a little over a year ago.</p>

<h3 id="restrospective">2016 Restrospective</h3>

<p>Between a new job, a house move, and a flurry of depressing news, my productivity took a hit in 2016. I was nevertheless able to do some fun things on the side:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Built and launched <a href="https://speedsterapp.com">Speedster</a>, a native bandwidth speed testing app for macOS. The feedback was very positive, but I <a href="/2016/speedster-a-retrospective">struggled with the business model</a>. As of now, the app is no longer available on the App Store, and version 3.0 is in the works (more on that later).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launched then open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/Markoff">Markoff</a>, a lightweight Markdown previewer app for macOS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Published <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/building-ios-interfaces-views">three</a> <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/building-ios-interfaces-custom-button">more</a> <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/building-ios-interfaces-subclassing-views">articles</a> in the <em>Designing for iOS</em> series that I started back in 2015.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/kaishin/status/706076592976629761">Customized an arcade stick</a> ðŸ•¹ and had a ton of fun doing it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Designed a macOS <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2730205-Undertale-Replacement-Icon">replacement icon</a> for <a href="http://undertale.com/">Undertale</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Released <a href="https://github.com/kaishin/ImageScout">ImageScout 1.0</a>, a Swift implementation of fastimage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Made a <a href="https://swiftbits.redalemeden.com/resources/swift-3-access-control/">visualization</a> on Swift 3.0 Access control.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gave <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kaishin/swift-3-api-best-practices-by-example">a talk</a> about Swift API guidelines at Cocoaheads Stockholm.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="january-2017">January 2017</h3>

<h4 id="code">Code</h4>

<p>Even though Iâ€™ve been writing less code outside of my full-time job, I managed to do a complete rewrite of <a href="https://speedsterapp.com">Speedster</a> 3.0 since last September. The app is now written in Swift 3.0 and no longer relies on the <a href="https://speedof.me">SpeedOfMe</a> API for the tests (good riddance). A good chunk of my time off last month went into revisiting the UI and hunting down a couple of timeout issues that Iâ€™d like to fix before pushing the first beta.</p>

<p>On the open-source front, I managed to release <a href="https://cocoapods.org/pods/Gifu">Gifu</a> 2.0 after 3 months of testing. The new version is written in Swift 3.0 and introduces a new protocol-based API that makes the library a lot more versatile.</p>

<p>Last but not least I managed to remove all anayltics from my websites. Yay privacy!</p>

<h4 id="design">Design</h4>

<p>I took a little break from code and spent some time refreshing the Speedster icon. I swapped the color palette and added some extra details to the needle as you can see on the <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/3252363-Speedster-3-0-Icon">Dribbble shot</a>.</p>

<h4 id="podcasting">Podcasting</h4>

<p>We resumed recording <a href="http://tentative.fm">Tentative</a> and the <a href="http://tentative.fm/31">1st episode</a> of the season is already out! We discussed our new yearâ€™s resolutions in a quite spontaneous and laid back episode.</p>

<h4 id="writing">Writing</h4>

<p>A little over ten years ago, I started a <em>manga</em> (Japanese comic) side project. I have been sporadically revisiting it since, adding tiny bits to the story and characters.<br />
As time went by however, I started losing the spark that initially got me going.</p>

<p>Last month, I discarded all but the name of the main protagonist the overall tone of the story. A new direction that will hopefully get the creative juices flowing and help me keep the momentum.</p>

<p>Creative writing aside, Iâ€™d like to push these updates more frequently to maintain my motivation and keep everyone interested in my side projects in the loop.</p>
